				<h3>Questioning</h3>
						<p>Zack was old, very old.  He'd prayed
						for years asking for a child, now he just asks that God will comfort
						his wife and bring her friends.  He had prayed that God would show
						him what they were doing wrong, why they were cursed with no
						children.  There was no answer, only SILENCE. 
						</p>
						
						<img src="" alt="" >
						
						<p>Zack kept working in the Temple.  In
						spite of his personal pain, he found joy in serving at the Temple in
						Jerusalem.  When it wasn't his turn to be there, you could find him
						at the synagogue in his home town.  Most of the time, you would find
						him at home with his wife, they didn't get many invites, most people
						were afraid their “curse” might rub off on them.</p>
						
						<p>Zack's turn in the Temple came, and he
						got chosen randomly to have the highest honer of the daily service. 
						He got to go all the way into the very heart of the temple, right in
						front of the holy of holies where God had promised to reside.  Only
						one person got to go in there each day.  He was supposed to light
						incense on the alter of incense and then come out and lead the people
						in prayer.  Luke chapter 1 tells us what happened to Zack, take a
						minute and read verses 5 through 25.</p>
						
						<p>Both Zachariah and his wife Elizabeth
						were <a href="http://bible.com/59/luk.1.6.esv">“righteous in the site of God” </a>.  Were
						they perfect?  No, but they followed God's way with their
						heart and they believed God. I know they believed God because just
						like today, it's not our sticking to a set of rules, but our
						believing that is <a href="http://bible.com/59/gen.15.6.esv">counted as righteousness </a></p>
						
						<p>So Zack went in lit the incense and
						found out how much God wasn't stuck behind that great curtain
						dividing off the Holy-of-Holies.  God was in the room with Zachariah,
						and His messenger appeared there and about scared poor old Zack to
						death.  The angel Gabriel says “don't be afraid”, do you think
						Zack was able to follow that order?  Zackariah did calm down enough
						to listen.  Zack was told that he would have a son and that his son
						would do great things.  
						</p>
						
						<p>But then righteous, faithful, believing
						Zack questions the angel.  We're not told why he asks the angel “How
						can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in
						years.”&lt;link&gt;  Maybe he was a candidate for Viagra (a lot of
						scholars think so) or maybe he was thinking about his wife, “If I
						go home and tell Elizabeth and then she doesn't have a baby she will
						hate me.”</p>
						
						<p>All we know is these are the last words
						Zachariah spoke for quite a while.  The angel says this is “because
						you did not believe my words”&lt;link&gt;  This old man of God
						doubted right in front of this angel that had him scared spit-less.  
						He was struck dumb because of it.  Should we use this as an example
						to say we should never doubt or question God?  Before we do that,
						lets look some others that doubted and questioned God in the bible.</p>
						
						<UL>
							<LI><p>Gideon asked for a sign, got it
							and then asked for another. &lt;Judges 6:36&gt; 
							</p>
							<LI><p>Both Abraham and Sarah laughed at
							the idea of God finally fulfilling a promise they had stopped
							believing. &lt;<A HREF="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2017:17-22,%20Genesis%2018:10-15&amp;version=NIV">Genesis
							17:17-22, 18:10-15</A>&gt;  
							</p>
							<LI><p>Thomas had to touch the
							resurrected Jesus before he would accept that it was him.&lt;John
							20:24-29&gt;</p>
						</UL>
						
						<p>I could go on and on with people in the
						bible that questioned or doubted God at some moment in their life,
						but they went on to do great things and show great trust in God.  So
						instead of hiding our doubts and ignoring our questions, I challenge
						you to face them head on, seek answers and in the journey you will
						draw closer to God.
